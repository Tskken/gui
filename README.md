# Go-UI
 Go-UI is a experiment Golang UI using openGL and GLFW.

### Basic info, ideas, and goals

This is a experiment gui library writen in go and utilizing 
[go-gl/gl](https://github.com/go-gl/gl) and 
[go-gl/glfw](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw). 
It is a test to learn how to work with openGL and GLFW with in Go and a practise ground
for later projects. This also may be moved to a full fledged GUI if it can get to a 
point which I determine is usable as a full fledged gui library.

My goal with this library is to create a "dynamic" gui library which uses similar paradigms
to Android and IOS development. This library will utilize XML files for creating its UI 
elements. The hope is through using XML files, a "UI Builder" can be created in the future,
or the ability to modify the UI as the program is running and save the changes to the XML
files on shutdown.
